              "  i found it xxunk ( like the part about xxmaj keanu 's neck ... ) and some of it was funny . i xxunk xxmaj carrie - xxmaj anne s xxrep 4 o much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys . i found only one problem with it . xxmaj given that 95 % of the people there were as a matter of fact male , they just kinda let their mouths run wild , and there was language in it . xxmaj it 's not near as bad as xxmaj the xxmaj shawshank xxmaj redemption 's xxunk runs , but that one scene were xxmaj keanu is describing a bad day , plug your ears if you are little . xxunk \n",
